# Due to the following error, we have to manually copy paste contracts from Open Zeppelin
# error: Version solving failed:
# - openzeppelin v0.7.0 (git+https:#github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts.git?tag=v0.7.0#61a2505fe0c0f19b5de2b3f8dedf421ba2cff657) cannot use core::starknet v2.3.0-rc0 (std), because openzeppelin requires starknet >=2.2.0

# Scarb does not have real version solving algorithm yet.
# Perhaps in the future this conflict could be resolved, but currently,
